# Feed the Shark -- Learn some Phaser.js

This game was made as part of the TAG Training. We needed a little game to introduce Phases, Physics, different user input.  The goal is that through this game the instructors will be prepped to teach the other games. 

### Game Objective 
Eat all the fish. 

### Controls
To start the game click on the title (Feed the Shark)

In an effort to achieve realism, the shark cannot move directly up and down (cuz sharks cannot do that in the water) so to move use the left and right arrow keys and the up and down arrow keys to adjust the angle.
